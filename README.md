# Policy Happiness Study
### Presenting the data on happiness scores related to workplace policy. 

This study was conducted to analyse staff opinions in relation to their views on company policy. Staff were interviewed in regards to various different types of policy and an assessment could be made on how happy members of staff (in different positions) felt over time. 

As a brief summary - the study discovered that employees in different positions felt differently about each particular policy. This insight could then also be filtered by what region they were in to highlight particular areas for improvement in the company. 

The key findings were the summarised at the end of the report to deliver the major insights. These findings could also be utilised as a basis for a deeper investigation into how company policy could best serve each member of staff.
